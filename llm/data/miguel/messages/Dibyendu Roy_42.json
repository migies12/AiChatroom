This program is all about you, and we’re here to make it as fun and rewarding as possible. Whether you want to try new activities, explore the city, or just hang out and get to know each other in you group better, the choice is yours! \n\nEven better—your activities are on us! Each group can get reimbursed from $100 to $400 (depending on your group size) over the year. All we ask is that the mentors fill out a quick and easy survey to let us know how the meet-up went, and don’t forget to save those receipts!\n\nAlso, mark your calendars—the Kickstarter Event is happening on October 8th at 5:30 pm in KAIS 2020/2030, and we can’t wait to see all of you there!
